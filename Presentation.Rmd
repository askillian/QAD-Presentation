# Introduction

## What is a Copula?
A simple (implicit) definition of a Copula is as follows:

The joint distribution of two -- on $[0,1]$ -- continous random variables, restricted to $[0,1]^2$

This implies the following two properties, which are also used to define two-dimensional Copulae explicitly:

A function $A:[0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$ with the following properties:

1. $\forall x \in [0,1]: A(x,1) = A(1,x) = x, A(x,0) = A(0,x) = 0$

2. For  $0 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq 1$ and $0 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq 1$
